.SH NAME
tracker-store \- database indexer and query daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtracker-store\fR [\fIOPTION\fR...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tracker-store
provides both a powerful database daemon which allows clients to query
or update their data using the highly descriptive
.B SPARQL
language.
.PP
.B tracker-store
does not do any file crawling or any mining of data itself, instead
other processes do that while
.B tracker-store
serves as a daemon waiting for such
requests from application miners like
.B tracker-miner-fs.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-?, \-\-help
A brief help message including some examples.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Returns the version of this binary.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbosity={0|1|2|3}
Sets the logging level, 0=errors, 1=minimal, 2=detailed, 3=debug.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-force-reindex
This forces tracker-store to remove databases and to recreate fresh
databases ready for data insertion from the miners. For more
information about the miners, see
.B tracker-miner-fs.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-readonly-mode
This starts
.B tracker-store
in a mode which disables writing to the database. Only
.B SPARQL
read requests can be serviced if this option is used.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B TRACKER_DB_ONTOLOGIES_DIR
This is the directory which tracker uses to load the .ontology files
from. If unset it will default to the correct place. This is used
mainly for testing purposes.

.TP
.B TRACKER_LANGUAGE_STOP_WORDS_DIR
This is the directory which tracker uses to load the stop words
dictionaries from. If unset it will default to the correct place. This
is used mainly for testing purposes.

.TP
.B TRACKER_STORE_MAX_TASK_TIME
This is maximum time allowed for a process to finish before interruption
happens. The actual moment of interruption depends also on the frequency of
checks. The value 0 indicates no interruption.
This environment variable is used mainly for testing purposes.

.TP
.B TRACKER_STORE_SELECT_CACHE_SIZE / TRACKER_STORE_UPDATE_CACHE_SIZE
Tracker caches database statements which occur frequently to make
subsequent repeat queries much faster. The cache size is set to 100 by
default for each type (select and update queries). This must be at
least 2 as a minimum, any less and a value of 3 is used instead. The
number represents the number of cached statements to keep around.
This environment variable is used mainly for testing purposes.

.TP
.B TRACKER_PRAGMAS_FILE
Tracker has a fixed set of PRAGMA settings for creating its SQLite connection.
With this environment variable pointing to a text file you can override these
settings. The file is a \\n separated list of SQLite queries to execute on any
newly created SQLite connection in tracker-store.

.TP
.B TRACKER_DISABLE_MEEGOTOUCH_LOCALE
If Tracker is compiled with meegotouch locale management support, setting this
variable in the environment will disable retrieving the locale from GConf, and
the standard locale settings will be used instead.

.TP
.B TRACKER_USE_LOG_FILES
Don't just log to stdout and stderr, but to log files too which are
kept in $HOME/.local/share/tracker/. This came into effect in 0.15.3
and 0.16.0. After this version of Tracker, logging to file (usually
useful for debugging) can only be done by declaring this environment
variable.

.TP
.B TRACKER_USE_CONFIG_FILES
Don't use GSettings, instead use a config file similar to how settings
were saved in 0.10.x. That is, a file which is much like an .ini file.
These are saved to $HOME/.config/tracker/

.SH NOTES
.B tracker-store
is highly bound to the D-Bus freedesktop project. A D-Bus session is
needed for all Tracker processes to communicate between each other.
D-Bus is our acting IPC. See
.BR dbus-daemon(1)
for more information.
